## Running this shit

### Prerequisites

-   Git

### Linux

Setting up Pyrodactyl is a breeze on Linux. Follow the [official Pterodactyl documentation](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html) for your distribution up to the point where you need to download the panel.

Instead of downloading the official panel, follow the steps below to install Pyrodactyl:

1. `git clone https://github.com/kaneious/panel.git /var/www/pterodactyl`
2. `cd /var/www/pterodactyl`
3. `npm i`
4. `npm run ship`

Proceed with the rest of the installation as you would with the official panel.
